# MuZero
Implementing the MuZero algorithm for multiple games with PGX and MCTX. Thanks to Google's Tensorflow Research Cloud for providing compute resources(the checkpoints made with those resources will be released soon). The training script is modified from the sample AlphaZero script provided in the PGX GitHub Repo.
